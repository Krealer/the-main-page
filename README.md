# 🌐 The Main Page

**The Main Page** is a personal project hub designed to showcase and organize all of my public-facing web-based creations. This site serves as a clean, responsive landing page where visitors can explore games, educational tools, and future project categories — all from one place.

Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), it's fast, lightweight, and easy to maintain.
